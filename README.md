🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to help the marketing team understand and segment target customers based on their Annual Income, Age, and Mall Spending Score. 

By identifying distinct customer groups, the business can plan targeted marketing strategies to increase engagement and sales.

🎯 Problem Statement
Identify the most important shopping groups from mall customer data.

Group customers based on Income, Age, and Spending Score.

Determine the ideal number of groups and provide labels for each segment.

📂 Context
Your boss has requested a data-driven approach to:

Identify key customer segments.

Understand their purchasing patterns.

Recommend marketing strategies for each segment.

🛠 Approach
The project follows these steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Inspect data distribution, missing values, and variable relationships.

K-Means Clustering

Apply the K-Means algorithm to create customer segments.

Summary Statistics

Analyze each cluster’s demographics and spending patterns.

Visualization

Use scatter plots to show customer distribution across clusters.

📊 Analysis Highlights
Cluster 1:

High Spending Score & High Income.

60% are women — ideal for targeted marketing of premium products.

Cluster 2:

Presents potential for sales events on popular items.

Other clusters represent varying combinations of income and spending habits.
